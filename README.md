# Poor Man's Pentest - TMUX edition
This is a hastily written port of John Hammond's [poor-mans-pentest](https://github.com/JohnHammond/poor-mans-pentest) repository to use tmux and the send-keys command rather than xte and guake.

No guarantees any of it works.

Check out John's presentation at BsidesDE 2019 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2aSXGbD0NE).

# Usage
Each script expects a tmux window with two panes open, pane 1 is reserved for the target machine, so run scripts in pane 0 (or really any number other than 1).

The scripts have been modified as little as possible from the originals, changed only to handle the switch from an alt-tab to multi-pane workflow. If you're not sure how to run a script, just cat it to your console - they're all tiny

```sh
cat download_file_nc.sh
```

Best of luck!
